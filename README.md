# Credit Scoring Model

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha**.  
The objective is to build a **Credit Scoring Model** to predict an individual's creditworthiness using past financial data.

---

## 📌 **Problem Statement**

Predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment based on their financial and demographic information.

---

## 💡 **Approach**

✔️ **Data Loading**: UCI Default of Credit Card Clients dataset (Excel file).  
✔️ **Preprocessing**:  
- Dropped unnecessary columns (ID).  
- Handled missing values.  
- Standardized numerical features.  

✔️ **Algorithms Used**:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

✔️ **Evaluation Metrics**:  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC

---

## 🛠 **Libraries Used**

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## 📊 **Results**

All models were evaluated based on classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.  
Random Forest showed the best performance among the three algorithms.

---

## 🎯 **Learning Outcomes**

- Hands-on implementation of classification algorithms.  
- Feature scaling and data preprocessing for credit scoring.  
- Model evaluation using practical ML metrics and ROC curves.
